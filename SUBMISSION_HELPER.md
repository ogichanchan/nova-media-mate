1. **Plugin Name:** Nova Media Mate
2. **Short Description:** A unique PHP-only WordPress utility. A nova style media plugin acting as a mate. Focused on simplicity and efficiency.
3. **Detailed Description:** Nova Media Mate is a lightweight, PHP-only WordPress utility designed to streamline your media management by providing a simple way to duplicate any media item. The plugin adds a convenient "Duplicate" link in two key locations:
    *   Within the Media Library's list view, appearing under each media item's row actions.
    *   As a "Duplicate Media" button located in the "Publish" meta box on the individual attachment edit screen.

    When activated, the duplication process is comprehensive and secure:
    *   It copies the original media file to a new, unique location within your WordPress uploads directory.
    *   A new attachment post is created in the database, automatically titled "Copy of [Original Media Title]".
    *   All necessary attachment metadata, including thumbnails and image dimensions for images, is correctly generated and assigned to the new duplicate.
    *   The plugin includes robust security checks (nonce verification and user capability validation) and provides clear admin notices to inform the user of success or any issues.

    Focused on simplicity and efficiency, Nova Media Mate offers a direct solution for quickly creating copies of media files, enhancing your content workflow without relying on complex JavaScript or external libraries.
