== Description ==
Nova Media Mate is a straightforward and efficient PHP-only WordPress plugin designed to simplify media management by enabling quick duplication of media items. It integrates seamlessly into the WordPress admin interface, offering "Duplicate" links directly within the Media Library list table and a dedicated "Duplicate Media" button on the attachment edit screen.

Upon clicking, the plugin securely handles the entire duplication process: performing security checks, creating a new attachment post in the database, duplicating the actual media file (e.g., image, video, document) to a unique location, and generating all necessary attachment metadata (like thumbnails for images). This ensures the duplicated media item is a full, independent copy, ready for editing or reuse.

Focused on simplicity and efficiency, Nova Media Mate provides a fast, reliable way to create copies of existing media, saving time and streamlining content creation workflows without adding unnecessary bloat.

This plugin is open source. Report bugs at: https://github.com/ogichanchan/nova-media-mate
